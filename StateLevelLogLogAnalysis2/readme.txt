This code was created by Dan Butts (3/31/20)
-- following the idea presented here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54XLXg4fYsc
-- and here for country-level data: https://aatishb.com/covidtrends/
-- using state-level data from Covid-Tracking Project: https://covidtracking.com/us-daily/

I have reorganized the data downloaded on 3/30 into a matfile, and demonstrate how the plots are made in the PDF in the m-file. 

Please feel free to contact me with any questions. Dan Butts: dab@umd.edu
